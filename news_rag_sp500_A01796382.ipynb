        "1. **Perform Semantic Search with Metadata Filtering:**\n",
        "   - Query the provided FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant financial news articles based on natural language questions.\n",
        "   - Apply optional filters using metadata such as ticker or publication date to refine search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Enrich Data with Company Metadata:**\n",
        "   - Use the `yfinance` library to retrieve company-level metadata (company name, sector, industry) for tickers in the dataset.\n",
        "   - Integrate this metadata to support enhanced filtering and analysis of news data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline:**\n",
        "   - Combine retrieved news snippets as context to generate answers using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.\n",
        "   - Construct effective prompts that guide the language model to provide concise, context-aware responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Evaluate and Analyze RAG Outputs:**\n",
        "   - Review generated answers alongside the supporting news excerpts.\n",
        "   - Reflect on the strengths and limitations of the simple RAG pipeline and consider potential improvements, such as adding more filters or refining retrieval strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Incorporate Financial Metadata into Retrieval Context:**\n",
        "   - Enrich retrieved news snippets with key financial metadata including ticker, company name, sector, and industry.\n",
        "   - Format prompts that combine both text excerpts and metadata to provide richer context to the language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Generate Context-Aware Answers Using OpenAI Models:**\n",
        "   - Construct and send prompts to an LLM that leverage both news content and metadata to produce concise, informed financial analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Compare Answers With and Without Metadata:**\n",
        "   - Evaluate the impact of including financial metadata on answer quality using criteria such as clarity, detail, accuracy, and contextual relevance.\n",
        "   - Summarize findings to reflect on the role of metadata in improving retrieval-augmented generation."

This is reflected in stock price increases despite negative financial news.\n\n3. **International Revenue Trends**: The impact of international revenue on company forecasts is a recurring topic, highlighting how global sales can influence stock performance and investor sentiment (as noted in articles from May 13).\n\n4. **Stock Price Movements**: Notable price fluctuations, such as ON Semiconductor's stock surging by 30% despite challenging earnings, underline the market's responsiveness to investor confidence and share buyback programs (article dated May 14).\n\n5. **Market Conditions and Challenges**: Some articles reference broader market challenges, such as declining demand in specific segments like EVs (seen in May 26), while also recognizing growth opportunities in areas like SiC and AI Data Centers.\n\nOverall, the semiconductor industry appears to be characterized by a mix of cautious optimism regarding future potential and the volatility typical of tech stocks amid variable earnings results."
