        "1. **Perform Semantic Search with Metadata Filtering:**\n",
        "   - Query the provided FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant financial news articles based on natural language questions.\n",
        "   - Apply optional filters using metadata such as ticker or publication date to refine search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Enrich Data with Company Metadata:**\n",
        "   - Use the `yfinance` library to retrieve company-level metadata (company name, sector, industry) for tickers in the dataset.\n",
        "   - Integrate this metadata to support enhanced filtering and analysis of news data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline:**\n",
        "   - Combine retrieved news snippets as context to generate answers using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.\n",
        "   - Construct effective prompts that guide the language model to provide concise, context-aware responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Evaluate and Analyze RAG Outputs:**\n",
        "   - Review generated answers alongside the supporting news excerpts.\n",
        "   - Reflect on the strengths and limitations of the simple RAG pipeline and consider potential improvements, such as adding more filters or refining retrieval strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Incorporate Financial Metadata into Retrieval Context:**\n",
        "   - Enrich retrieved news snippets with key financial metadata including ticker, company name, sector, and industry.\n",
        "   - Format prompts that combine both text excerpts and metadata to provide richer context to the language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Generate Context-Aware Answers Using OpenAI Models:**\n",
        "   - Construct and send prompts to an LLM that leverage both news content and metadata to produce concise, informed financial analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Compare Answers With and Without Metadata:**\n",
        "   - Evaluate the impact of including financial metadata on answer quality using criteria such as clarity, detail, accuracy, and contextual relevance.\n",
        "   - Summarize findings to reflect on the role of metadata in improving retrieval-augmented generation."

Many price increases have already affected consumers, and an inventory overflow is anticipated due to a surge in imports ahead of a tariff pause, potentially leading to deeper discounts and margin pressures.
